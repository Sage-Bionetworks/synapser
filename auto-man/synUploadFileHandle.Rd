\item{path}{ file path to the file being uploaded\cr
}
\item{parent}{ parent of the entity to which we upload.\cr
}
\item{synapseStore}{ If False, will not upload the file, but instead create an ExternalFileHandle that references the file on the local machine.\cr

% Examples of how to use the function. 
% Examples are not only useful for documentation purposes, but also provide test code used for diagnostic checking of R code. 
% By default, text will be displayed in the output of the help page and run by example() and by R CMD check. 
% You can use \dontrun{} for text that should only be shown, but not run, and \dontshow{} for extra commands 
% for testing that should not be shown to users, but will be run by example().
