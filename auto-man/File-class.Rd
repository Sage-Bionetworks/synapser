Represents a file in Synapse.

When a File object is stored, the associated local file or its URL will be stored in Synapse. A File must have a
path (or URL) and a parent. By default, the name of the file in Synapse matches the filename, but by specifying
the `name` attribute, the File Entity name can be different.
