Constructor for objects of type DockerRepository
}
\description{
A Docker repository is a lightweight virtual machine image.

NOTE: store()-ing a DockerRepository created in the Python client will always result in it being treated as a 
reference to an external Docker repository that is not managed by synapse. 
To upload a docker image that is managed by Synapse please use the official Docker client and read http://docs.synapse.org/articles/docker.html for instructions on uploading a Docker Image to Synapse

% for testing that should not be shown to users, but will be run by example().
