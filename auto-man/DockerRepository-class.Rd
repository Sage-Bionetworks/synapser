\description{
A Docker repository is a lightweight virtual machine image.

NOTE: store()-ing a DockerRepository created in the Python client will always result in it being treated as a
reference to an external Docker repository that is not managed by synapse.
To upload a docker image that is managed by Synapse please use the official Docker client and read
https://help.synapse.org/docs/Synapse-Docker-Registry.2011037752.html for instructions on uploading a Docker Image to Synapse
