% Examples of how to use the function. 
% Examples are not only useful for documentation purposes, but also provide test code used for diagnostic checking of R code. 
% By default, text will be displayed in the output of the help page and run by example() and by R CMD check. 
% You can use \dontrun{} for text that should only be shown, but not run, and \dontshow{} for extra commands 
% for testing that should not be shown to users, but will be run by example().
