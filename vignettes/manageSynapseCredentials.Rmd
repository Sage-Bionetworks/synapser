## Manage Synapse Credentials

There are multiple ways one can login to Synapse. We recommend users to choose the method that fits their workflow.

### One Time Login

Login using a personal access token obtained from synapse.org under your Settings. Note that a token must minimally have the view scope to be used with synapser.  Learn how to [create a personal access token](https://help.synapse.org/docs/Managing-Your-Account.2055405596.html#ManagingYourAccount-PersonalAccessTokens)

```
library(synapser)
synLogin(authToken="authtoken")
```

### Use `.synapseConfig`

For writing code using the `synapser` client, that is easy to share with others, please do not include your credentials in the code. Instead, please use `.synapseConfig` file. You can refer your collaborators to the following documentation on how to set up a `.synapseConfig` file.

First, create a `.synapseConfig` file in your home directory with the following content:
```
[authentication]
authtoken = <authtoken>
```

A personal access token generated from your synapse.org Settings can be used as your .synapseConfig authtoken.

Then login without specifying your username and password:
```
library("synapser")
synLogin()
```
