## Troubleshooting

### Build Synapser
When You install Synapser, You may encounter a similar error:

```{console}
$ R CMD BUILD .

Execution halted
ERROR: configuration failed for package ‘synapser’
* removing ‘/private/var/folders/2n/xwh21m9s3sq_mhnkbc6n6z_c0000gn/T/RtmpZ47UPP/Rinstf55478c3f09/synapser’
```

For this error, You can try first remove $HOME\.virtualenvs then run the build command again.

### Build Synapser when creating vignettes
When you build synapser, you may encounter the following error:

```{console}
$ R CMD BUILD .

Error: processing vignette 'upload.Rmd' failed with diagnostics:
No credentials provided.
--- failed re-building ‘upload.Rmd’
```

First, create a file named `.synapseConfig` in your home directory. Then add the following lines to the file:

```{console}
[authentication]
username = your_username
password = your_password
```

Now, you should be able to build Synapser.

### Using Synapser with reticulate

Synapser is compatible with [reticulate](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/) and the two packages can be used together in the same R session.

As a workaround, if you wish to communicate with Synapse in an R session that also uses reticulate, you can use the [Synapse Python client](https://python-docs.synapse.org/build/html/index.html) through reticulate.
