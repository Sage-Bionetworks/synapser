## Docker

The `synapser` package has low level dependencies like openssl, zlib and the development version of curl.  These are usually 
provided in linux installations but if you are using the r-base Docker image (https://hub.docker.com/_/r-base/) they are not
included.  The following Dockerfile ensures the required dependencies are in place and also installs `synapser`.


```{r collapse=TRUE, eval=F}
FROM r-base
RUN rm /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/default
RUN apt-get update -y
RUN apt-get install -y dpkg-dev zlib1g-dev libssl-dev
RUN apt-get install -y curl libcurl3 libcurl3-dev
RUN R -e "install.packages('synapser', repos=c('https://sage-bionetworks.github.io/ran', 'https://cran.cnr.berkeley.edu'))"
```
